This is where your .jsons for charts go.
They should be placed under song/song.json for normal, and song/song-difficulty.json for anything else.

This is also where you should place your .txt for credits and patch notes.
They should be labled "credits.txt" or "patch.txt".
Formatting is as follows:

username::icon::name::role::description::link::color

version::icon::name::subtitle::notes::link::color
